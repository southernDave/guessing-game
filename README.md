# guessing-game
a simple guessing game built with rust, I was aided by some libraries like rand for generating random numbers, "colored" for making the results generate colours(
red for "too small", green for "just right", yellow for "too big")
it was fun doing this project as it helped me grasped certain concepts I had been trying to master. basically I saw all my learnings make sense in one project
